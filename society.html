            <p class="info"  > Information about Bicycles </p>
            <p>Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century in Europe, and by the early 21st century, 
              more than 1 billion were in existence at a given time.These numbers far exceed the number of cars, 
              both in total and ranked by the number of individual models produced.
               They are the principal means of transportation in many regions. 
               They also provide a popular form of recreation, and have been adapted for use as children s toys,
                general fitness, military and police applications, courier services, bicycle racing, and bicycle stunts.

              The basic shape and configuration of a typical upright or "safety bicycle",
               has changed little since the first chain-driven model was developed around 1885.
                However, many details have been improved, especially since the advent of modern materials and computer-aided design.
                 These have allowed for a proliferation of specialized designs for many types of cycling.

The bicycle s invention has had an enormous effect on society, both in terms of culture and of advancing modern industrial methods.
 Several components that eventually played a key role in the development of the automobile were initially invented for use in the bicycle,
  including ball bearings, pneumatic tires, chain-driven sprockets and tension-spoked wheels.[10]

Although bike and cycle are used interchangeably to refer mostly to two types of two-wheelers the terms still vary across the world. 
In India for example a cycle refers only to a two-wheeler using pedal power whereas the term bike is used to describe a two-wheeler using internal 
combustion engine or electric motors as a source of motive power instead of motorcycle/motorbike.A bicycle, also called a bike or cycle, is 
a human-powered or motor-powered, pedal-driven, single-track vehicle, having two wheels attached to a frame, one behind the other.
 A bicycle rider is called a cyclist, or bicyclist
